# Knife Switch
A big, mad scientist knife switch with sound, haptics, and home automation.

The knife switch project consists of the following:
1. Physical switch made of wood, copper, and cloth wrapped wire
2. Raspberry Pi running a server to play sounds, control the haptic driver, and make calls to home automation
3. Connector box that houses the haptic driver, amplifier, and status indicator.

All of this could have been built into the switch and I probably have an unnecessarily complex nest of cabling, but a Pi controlled switch is already a Rube Goldberg machine, so why not go all out. Plus, it gave me an excuse to use some cool, antique-looking cloth wrapped wire and aviation plugs.
